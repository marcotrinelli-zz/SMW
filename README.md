`Snips NLU <https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io>`_ (Natural Language Understanding) is a Python library that allows to parse sentences written in natural language and extracts structured information.

Check out our `blog post`_ to get more details about why we built Snips NLU and how it works under the hood.

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: python

    pip install snips-nlu

We currently have pre-built binaries (wheels) for ``snips-nlu`` and its
dependencies for MacOS and Linux x86_64. If you use a different
architecture/os you will need to build these dependencies from sources
which means you will need to install
`setuptools_rust <https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust>`_ and
`Rust <https://www.rust-lang.org/en-US/install.html>`_ before running the
``pip install snips-nlu`` command.

Language resources
------------------

Snips NLU relies on `language resources`_ that must be downloaded before the
library can be used. You can fetch resources for a specific language by
running the following command:

.. code-block:: sh

    python -m snips_nlu download en

Or simply:

.. code-block:: sh

    snips-nlu download en

Once the resources have been fetched, they can be loaded in Python using:

.. code-block:: python

    from snips_nlu import load_resources

    load_resources("en")

The list of supported languages is available
`here <https://snips-nlu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/languages.html>`_.

A simple example
----------------

Letâ€™s take an example to illustrate the main purpose of this lib, and consider the following sentence:

.. code-block:: text

    "What will be the weather in paris at 9pm?"

Properly trained, the Snips NLU engine will be able to extract structured data such as:

.. code-block:: json

    {
       "intent": {
          "intentName": "searchWeatherForecast",
          "probability": 0.95
       },
       "slots": [
          {
             "value": "paris",
             "entity": "locality",
             "slotName": "forecast_locality"
          },
          {
             "value": {
                "kind": "InstantTime",
                "value": "2018-02-08 20:00:00 +00:00"
             },
             "entity": "snips/datetime",
             "slotName": "forecast_start_datetime"
          }
       ]
    }


Sample code
-----------

Here is a sample code that you can run on your machine after having
installed `snips-nlu`, fetched the english resources and downloaded this
`sample dataset`_:

.. code-block:: python

    from __future__ import unicode_literals, print_function

    import io
    import json

    from snips_nlu import SnipsNLUEngine, load_resources
    from snips_nlu.default_configs import CONFIG_EN

    with io.open("sample_dataset.json") as f:
        sample_dataset = json.load(f)

    load_resources("en")
    nlu_engine = SnipsNLUEngine(config=CONFIG_EN)
    nlu_engine.fit(sample_dataset)

    text = "What will be the weather in San Francisco next week?"
    parsing = nlu_engine.parse(text)
    print(json.dumps(parsing, indent=2))

What it does is training an NLU engine on a sample weather dataset and parsing
a weather query.
